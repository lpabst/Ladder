# Overview
- This is a reproduction of an old game called Ladder that I used to play on the K-Pro 2

## TODO
### Basics
- add obstacle collision
    - add little foods that you can eat that give you points
- add timer to each level

### Backend
- add a high score table 
- earning a high score allows the player to enter a name into the high score table
- host the game with simple backend for high scores on heroku or something. 
    - add some logic to check for cheating!


## BUGS
- hold arrow keys and jump and you can fall through a wall sometimes
- land on a vertical wall and you can fall into it sometimes and get trapped
- arrow keys aren't as responsive as I want them to be
