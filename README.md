# Overview
- This is a reproduction of an old game called Ladder that I used to play on the K-Pro 2

## TODO
- add gravity for entities to fall
- make enemies spawn from a location and move around, then eventually disappear off the map at the bottom
- add obstacle collision
    - add ground that the player doesn't fall through
    - add spikes that kill the player
    - hitting an enemy kills the player
    - add little foods that you can eat that give you points
    - add little foods that you can eat that give you an extra life
    - add a destination that finishes the level
- make it so player can move upward on ladders, and space bar to jump
- add how many lives the player has
- add multiple levels for the player to go through
- add a high score table 
- earning a high score allows the player to enter a name into the high score table
- host the game with simple backend for high scores on heroku or something. 
    - add some logic to check for cheating!
