# Overview
- This is a reproduction of an old game called Ladder that I used to play on the K-Pro 2

## TODO
## Enemy Movement
- When an enemy hits a ladder, it should make a choice to either continue, reverse direction, or go down (if available)

### Levels
- build some levels based on the youtube video above

### Backend
- add a high score table 
- earning a high score allows the player to enter a name into the high score table
- host the game with simple backend for high scores on heroku or something. 
    - add some logic to check for cheating!
