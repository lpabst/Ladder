# Overview
- This is a reproduction of an old game called Ladder that I used to play on the K-Pro 2

## TODO
### Map
- add a one directional wall where you can fall through but not jump up it
    - enemies can choose to fall through or traverse these
    - update the maps to include these where they should be
### Bugs
- Walls 60 vertical pixels apart you can stick to the bottom of the wall with a double jump???
- I can vertically jump up the edge of a wall if I just keep pressing the jump button....

### Backend
- add a high score table 
- earning a high score allows the player to enter a name into the high score table
- host the game with simple backend for high scores on heroku or something. 
    - add some logic to check for cheating!
