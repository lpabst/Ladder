# Overview
- This is a reproduction of an old game called Ladder that I used to play on the K-Pro 2

## TODO
### Levels
- build some levels

### Backend
- add a high score table 
- earning a high score allows the player to enter a name into the high score table
- host the game with simple backend for high scores on heroku or something. 
    - add some logic to check for cheating!
